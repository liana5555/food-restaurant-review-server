# About the project

This is the server side app of my food and restaurant reviewing web app. 
This is a **hypotetical website** in that sense that there aren't real users and 
If you try it out and register with your own and existing personal information **there is no guarantee that it would stay safe since the database is hosted on a free site** where demos are hosted. I don't hold any responsibility if your data gets stolen. 

You can use test / test as username and password to log in and try it.

The frontend for this is in another repository.

The build folder contains the the builded front end code. 


## The capabilities of the app

- There are 3 types of registered users: 
    - admin

- Normal users can do the following: 
    - log in
    - write posts / update their posts / delete their posts
    - write comments / delete their comments
    - manage their profile: changing first name, last name etc., delete their profile, changing psw
    - chat: creating chat groups and chat (leaving the group is not done yet)
